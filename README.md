# Project-14-Cpp
# ➗ Division Calculator with Zero-Check

A simple C++ program that divides two integers entered by the user.  
It also includes error handling to prevent **division by zero**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

1. Asks the user for two integers (`num1` and `num2`)  
2. Checks if the second number (`num2`) is zero  
3. If it is zero → displays an **error message**  
4. Otherwise → calculates and displays the division result
